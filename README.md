Description:
The prupose of this project is to create a random password generator that generates upon clicking a button. This project is really a chance to build upon the javascript information we have been learing in this course. It started us with some pre-built elements, and from there we had to build in the rest of the java script to make the generator function properly.

Installation:
I think the challenging part of the installation was breaking down all of the elements I would need to add. First I had to see the code that was already in place.  I analyzed what was built, then begun writing down what was left to do. I think I catagorize the code break down in 2 parts. First the variables I would need to set up to make the paramaters of the password, and then secondly the functions needed to execute that code. 


Usage:
This generator is a rewarding project showing the power behind javascript. I really believe I will get the most use from this, being able to reflect on how to build a project up using varibles and function in javascript. 

Credits:
The most benifical things  in creating this project was the class material, hours of research and tutorials, and finally leaning on tutoring and classroom support. All of these seprately helped me to build this project.
